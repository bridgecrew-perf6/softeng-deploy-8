# Homework 05 | Deploy app from GitHub to Azure (40 points) 



Our instructor: Jeff Maxwell assigned us to: 

1) Create a GitHub Repository named “softeng-deploy” (this needs to be a public  repository) 
2) Create an account in Azure 
3) Create a “Static Web App” and connect it to the GitHub repo you created. 4) Add an index.html file with the following code: 
<html> 
<head> 
<title>Static Web App</title> 
</head> 
<body> 
<h1>Hello from [YOUR NAME]</h1> 
</body> 
</html> 
5) Commit your changes (which should publish to the server) 
6) Include screenshots and a link to the published site. 


This repo is used as a starter for a _very basic_ HTML web application using no front-end frameworks.
